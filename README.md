# POS-Entropy-Calculator
This repository provides a simple Python tool for calculating the entropy of Part-of-Speech (POS) distributions for each word in a dataset. Entropy is used as an indicator of potential POS labeling inconsistency, which is especially useful for corpus cleaning, dataset validation, and linguistic analysis.
